Overview of the data:
Data consists of the parking citations issued in the City of Baltimore over the last four years. This is a huge data set with a memory of 842.5 MB. However, I am considering only the month of April of the 2019 and 2020 years which reduces the size significantly (approximately to 30 MB).

Record count of original data is 4705888. However, the data under the study has record count of 177040.

Size of data under study: 30 MB.

Proposed objectives of the project:
• Clean and format the data as necessary.

• Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the violations distribution across vehicles of different states and see if out of state vehicles have more violations than in state vehicles?

• To analyze the change in the violation count due to the implementation of lock down due to novel COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 in comparison to 2019.

• To see if how the violations are distributed across various vehicle makes.

• To see the frequency of types of violation occurred during the month of April in 2019 and 2020.

• To analyze the distribution of violation charges and look for any changes observed in 2020 in comparison to 2019.
